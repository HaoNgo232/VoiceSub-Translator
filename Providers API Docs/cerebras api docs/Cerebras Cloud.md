Due to high demand in our early launch phase:
1. We are temporarily limiting Llama 3.1 models to a context window of 8192 in our Free Tier.
2. You may experience rate limits over shorter time intervals. For example, a rate limit of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 requests per second. This also helps us mitigate against misuse and make sure everybody gets fair access to the platform.
