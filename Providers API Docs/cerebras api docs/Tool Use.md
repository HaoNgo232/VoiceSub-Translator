The Cerebras Inference SDK supports tool use, enabling programmatic execution of specific tasks by sending requests with clearly defined operations. This guide will walk you through a detailed example of how to use tool use with the Cerebras Inference SDK.

For a more detailed conceptual guide to tool use and function calling, please visit our AI Agent Bootcamp [section](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/agent-bootcamp/section-2) on the topic.

Tool calling is currently enabled via prompt engineering, but strict adherence to expected outputs is not yet guaranteed. The LLM autonomously determines whether to call a tool. An update is in progress to improve reliability in future versions.

In this case, the LLM determined that a tool call was appropriate to answer the usersâ€™ question of what the result of 15 multiplied by 7 is. See the output below.

## Conclusion

Tool use is an important feature that extends the capabilities of LLMs by allowing them to access pre-defined tools. Here are some more resources to continue learning about tool use with the Cerebras Inference SDK.
