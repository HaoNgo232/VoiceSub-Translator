<v ->Welcome to this React and TypeScript course.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.700
My name is Maximilian Schwarzmuller.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.680
I'll be your instructor in this course,

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.900
and together in this course,

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.250
we're going to gradually step-by-step explore

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.030
how you can use TypeScript in conjunction with React

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.850
to make your React app code more type safe,

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.240
since that's the core idea of TypeScript,

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.120
as you will also see throughout this course.
